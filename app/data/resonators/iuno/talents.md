## Forte Circuit: Ebb and Flow

**Lunar Cycle**

Iuno can activate Lunar Cycle by casting Resonance Skill - Closing Refrain or Resonance Liberation. Lunar Cycle has two states: Half Moon and New Moon. By default, Iuno enters the Half Moon state when activating Lunar Cycle and can switch between the two states by casting Heavy Attack - Flux.

When in Lunar Cycle:

- Iuno's Jump is replaced with Heavy Attack - Flux. STA won't recover when Iuno is in mid-air.

- Iuno's movement becomes Meandering, which consumes STA continuously in mid-air to move in a unique manner.

- Performing environmental interactions, using Utilities, or holding Jump will end Lunar Cycle.

**Lunar Cycle - Half Moon**

Iuno attacks using the Moonring, restoring Sentience on hit.

She can use Heavy Attack - Flux: Moonbow to deal Aero DMG (considered as Resonance Liberation DMG) and switch to Lunar Cycle - New Moon.

Heavy Attack - Flux: Moonbow can be cast in mid-air.

**Lunar Cycle New Moon**

Iuno attacks using the Moonbow. While in this state, casting Moonbow - Basic Attack, Resonance Skill - Arc Beyond the Edge, or Moonbow - Dodge Counter consumes Sentience to increase the skill's DMG Multiplier, restore additional Concerto Energy, and heal nearby Resonators in the team.

Iuno can use Heavy Attack - Flux: Moonring to deal Aero DMG (considered as Resonance Liberation DMG) and switch to Lunar Cycle - Half Moon.

Heavy Attack - Flux: Moonring can be cast in mid-air.

**Heavy Attack - Absolute Fullness**

When Iuno's Concerto Energy is full, her Heavy Attack is replaced with Absolute Fullness.

Casting Absolute Fullness ends Lunar Cycle, provides healing for nearby Resonators in the team, deals Aero DMG to nearby targets (considered as Resonance Liberation DMG), and conjures a Full Moon domain at her location. This effect can be triggered once every 25s.

Can be cast in mid-air.

**Full Moon Domain**

Resonators inside the domain periodically restore HP and STA.

Gaining a Shield inside the domain grants 1 stack of Blessing of the Wan Light. This effect can be triggered once every 0.5s.

**Blessing of the Wan Light**

The receiving Resonator gains 4% all DMG Amplification for 10s, stacking up to 10 times. Gaining new stacks resets the duration. This effect ends early if the receiving Resonator is switched off the field.

**Sentience**

- Iuno can hold up to 100 points of Sentience.

- Casting Intro Skill restores 40 points of Sentience.

- Casting Resonance Liberation restores 60 points of Sentience.

- Casting Closing Refrain or Unfinished Refrain restores 25 points of Sentience.
